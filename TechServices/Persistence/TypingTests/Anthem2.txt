the root of all the evils on earth, the root of man's torture by men, and of
an unspeakable lie. The word "We" is as lime poured over men, which sets and
hardens to stone, and crushes all beneath it, and that which is white and that
which is black are lost equally in the grey of it. It is the word by which the
depraved steal the virtue of the good, by which the weak steal the might of
the strong, by which the fools steal the wisdom of the sages.
What is my joy if all hands, even the unclean, can reach into it? What is my
wisdom, if even the fools can dictate to me? What is my freedom, if all
creatures, even the botched and the impotent, are my masters? What is my life,
if I am but to bow, to agree agree, and to obey?
