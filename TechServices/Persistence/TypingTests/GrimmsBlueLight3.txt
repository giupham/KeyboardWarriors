‘Tomorrow, you shall only do me a very trifling piece of work. Behind my
house, there is an old dry well, into which my light has fallen, it burns
blue, and never goes out, and you shall bring it up again.’ Next day the old
woman took him to the well, and let him down in a basket. He found the blue
light, and made her a signal to draw him up again. She did draw him up, but
when he came near the edge, she stretched down her hand and wanted to take the
blue light away from him. ‘No,’ said he, perceiving her evil intention, ‘I
will not give you the light until I am standing with both feet upon the
ground.’ The witch fell into a passion, let him fall again into the well, and
went away.
The poor soldier fell without injury on the moist ground, and the blue light
went on burning, but of what use was that to him? He saw very well that he
could not escape death.
