But I am done with this creed of corruption.
I am done with the monster of "We," the word of serfdom, of plunder, of
misery, falsehood and shame.
And now I see the face of god, and I raise this god over the earth, this god
whom men have sought since men came into being, this god who will grant them
joy and peace and pride.
This god, this one word: "I."
It was when I read the first of the books I found in my house that I saw the
word "I." And when I understood this word, the book fell from my hands, and I
wept, I who had never known tears. I wept in deliverance and in pity for all
mankind.
I understood the blessed thing which I had called my curse. I understood why
the best in me had been my sins and my transgressions; and why I had never
felt guilt in my sins. I understood that centuries of chains and lashes will
not kill the spirit of man nor the sense of truth within him.
I read many books for many days. Then I called the Golden One, and I told her
what I had read and what I had learned. She looked at me and the first words
she spoke were: "I love you."
