served the king faithfully, but he has dismissed me, and left me to hunger,
and now I want to take my revenge.’ ‘What am I to do?’ asked the little man.
‘Late at night, when the king’s daughter is in bed, bring her here in her

thing for me to do, but a very dangerous thing for you, for if it is
discovered, you will fare ill.’ When twelve o’clock had struck, the door
sprang open, and the manikin carried in the princess.
