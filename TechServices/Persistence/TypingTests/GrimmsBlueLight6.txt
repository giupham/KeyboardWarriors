The soldier returned to the town from which he came. He went to the best inn,
ordered himself handsome clothes, and then bade the landlord furnish him a
room as handsome as possible. When it was ready and the soldier had taken

served the king faithfully, but he has dismissed me, and left me to hunger,
and now I want to take my revenge.’ ‘What am I to do?’ asked the little man.
‘Late at night, when the king’s daughter is in bed, bring her here in her
sleep, she shall do servant’s work for me.’ The manikin said: ‘That is an easy
thing for me to do, but a very dangerous thing for you, for if it is
discovered, you will fare ill.’ When twelve o’clock had struck, the door
sprang open, and the manikin carried in the princess.
