There’s one comfort, the baby is well and happy, and does not have to occupy
this nursery with the horrid wallpaper.
If we had not used it that blessed child would have! What a fortunate escape!
Why, I wouldn’t have a child of mine, an impressionable little thing, live in
such a room for worlds.
I never thought of it before, but it is lucky that John kept me here after
all. I can stand it so much easier than a baby, you see.
Of course I never mention it to them any more,—I am too wise,—but I keep watch
of it all the same.
There are things in that paper that nobody knows but me, or ever will.
Behind that outside pattern the dim shapes get clearer every day.
It is always the same shape, only very numerous.
And it is like a woman stooping down and creeping about behind that pattern. I
don’t like it a bit. I wonder—I begin to think—I wish John would take me away
from here!
