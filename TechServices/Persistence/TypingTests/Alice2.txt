No, it'll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.'
Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began
talking again.'Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I should think!'
(Dinah was the cat.) 'I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at
tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There
are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and
that's very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?'
And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself,
in a dreamy sort of way, 'Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?' and
sometimes, 'Do bats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer
either question, it didn't much matter which way she put it.
