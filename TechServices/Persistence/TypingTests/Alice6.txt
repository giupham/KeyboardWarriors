For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice
had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.
There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to
the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book
of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little
bottle on it, (‘which certainly was not here before,’ said Alice,) and round
the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words ‘DRINK ME’
beautifully printed on it in large letters.
It was all very well to say ‘Drink me,’ but the wise little Alice was not
going to do that in a hurry. ‘No, I’ll look first,’ she said, ‘and see whether
it’s marked “poison” or not’; for she had read several nice little histories
about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other
unpleasant things, all because they would not remember the simple rules their
friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you
hold it too long.
