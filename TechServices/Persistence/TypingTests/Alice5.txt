However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not
noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high:
she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!
Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much
larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the
loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and
wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she
could not even get her head through the doorway; ‘and even if my head would go
through,’ thought poor Alice, ‘it would be of very little use without my shoulders.
Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew
how to begin.’
