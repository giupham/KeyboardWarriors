There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice
had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she
walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.
Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass;
there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice's first thought
was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either
the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would
not open any of them.
