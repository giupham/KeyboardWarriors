‘Do give me one night’s lodging, and a little to eat and drink,’ said he to
her, ‘or I shall starve.’ ‘Oho!’ she answered, ‘who gives anything to a
run-away soldier? Yet will I be compassionate, and take you in, if you will do
what I wish.’ ‘What do you wish?’ said the soldier. ‘That you should dig all
round my garden for me, tomorrow.’ The soldier consented, and next day
laboured with all his strength, but could not finish it by the evening. ‘I see
well enough,’ said the witch, ‘that you can do no more today, but I will keep
you yet another night, in payment for which you must tomorrow chop me a load
of wood, and chop it small.’ The soldier spent the whole day in doing it, and
in the evening the witch proposed that he should stay one night more.
