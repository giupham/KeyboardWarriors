The little man took him by the hand, and led him through an underground
passage, but he did not forget to take the blue light with him. On the way the
dwarf showed him the treasures which the witch had collected and hidden there,
and the soldier took as much gold as he could carry. When he was above, he
said to the little man: ‘Now go and bind the old witch, and carry her before
the judge.’ In a short time she came by like the wind, riding on a wild
tom-cat and screaming frightfully. Nor was it long before the little man
reappeared. ‘It is all done,’ said he, ‘and the witch is already hanging on
the gallows. What further commands has my lord?’ inquired the dwarf. ‘At this
moment, none,’ answered the soldier; ‘you can return home, only be at hand
immediately, if I summon you.’
