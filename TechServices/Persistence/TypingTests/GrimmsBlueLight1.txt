There was once upon a time a soldier who for many years had served the king
faithfully, but when the war came to an end could serve no longer because of
the many wounds which he had received. The king said to him: ‘You may return
to your home, I need you no longer, and you will not receive any more money,
for he only receives wages who renders me service for them.’ Then the soldier
did not know how to earn a living, went away greatly troubled, and walked the
whole day, until in the evening he entered a forest. When darkness came on, he
saw a light, which he went up to, and came to a house wherein lived a witch.
