and Julia.
But he said I wasnâ€™t able to go, nor able to stand it after I got there; and I
did not make out a very good case for myself, for I was crying before I had

It is getting to be a great effort for me to think straight. Just this nervous
weakness, I suppose.
And dear John gathered me up in his arms, and just carried me upstairs and
laid me on the bed, and sat by me and read to me till it tired my head.
He said I was his darling and his comfort and all he had, and that I must take
care of myself for his sake, and keep well.
He says no one but myself can help me out of it, that I must use my will and
self-control and not let any silly fancies run away with me.
